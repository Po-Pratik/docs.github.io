# Overview

Kerberos Authentication support is particularly useful for Enterprise
networks that have a Microsoft AD based Domain controller. By properly
configuring the necessary Kerberos related factors, your enterprise
Internet users can optionally enjoy Windows Integrated Authentication.
Windows Integrated Authentication is a non-interactive authentication
process, that uses SSO authentication. SSO ensures that your users do
not have to manually provide their user credentials as username /
password to access your networked enterprise resources and services,
yet their access is restricted as specified. SSO, thus not only just
adds convenience to the overall user experience, but also enhances
security.
