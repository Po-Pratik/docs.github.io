# Overview

SafeSquid Proxy Service has a browser-based intrinsic WebGUI that allows users to configure and manage its various features. To access the interface, you must configure your web browser to use the SafeSquidÂ® proxy server. You should be able to access the WebGUI with the URL - [1].

# Prerequisites

To access the SafeSquid User Interface, you must configure your web browser to use the SafeSquid proxy server. We recommend you configure SafeSquid Proxy into Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox Browser.

**Note**: You can configure SafeSquid to permit access to the User Interface only for security administrators.

The main page or starting page of the interface displays the dashboard of SafeSquid. When you access the SafeSquid interface for the first time, it will prompt you to upload your activation.
