# Overview

With the rise in cyber threats, protecting computer systems is crucial. The main entry point for malware is the Internet, especially through web services. To safeguard computers, multiple protection layers are essential. SafeSquid offers three antivirus protection methods:

- SvScan Antivirus
- ClamAV Antivirus
- ICAP Antivirus

# Prerequisite

For HTTPS site virus scans, SafeSquid's HTTPS Inspection must be activated. Refer to the [How to enable HTTPS Inspection](#) guide for setup.

# SvScan

SafeSquid's integrated SvScan module shields users from viruses, Trojans, malware, and other threats. SvScan scans both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

# ClamAV antivirus

ClamAV, an additional security layer alongside SvScan, combats viruses. As an open-source antivirus engine, ClamAV detects viruses, trojans, malware, and other threats. It supports various file formats and employs a multi-thread scanner. With ClamAV, users can identify and block files known to the ClamAV daemon scanner. Integration of your own ClamAV server with SafeSquid is also possible.

# ICAP antivirus

ICAP antivirus conducts virus scanning, content alteration, and blocks unsuitable content. With SafeSquid, you can integrate various ICAP servers.

## Dr. Webâ€™s ICAP based antivirus

In this setup, a client communicates with an HTTP server via a proxy server, which acts as an ICAP server client (Dr. Web ICAP). Dr. Web ICAP, a Dr. Web Daemon client, permits virus scanning of all HTTP traffic via the ICAP protocol. However, FTP traffic scanning is not supported. Note: HTTPS traffic remains unscanned due to encryption.

## Kaspersky Antivirus for Proxy Server

Kaspersky Antivirus offers essential PC protection against viruses, ransomware, and more. Features include file, software, and website scans, anti-phishing, ransomware protection, internet traffic control, vulnerability search, etc.

## Symantec Scan Engine

Symantec Endpoint Protection is a comprehensive security software suite, providing intrusion prevention, firewall, and anti-malware functionalities. The Symantec Scan Engine, a TCP/IP server and API, allows third parties to incorporate Symantec content scanning tech into their applications.

## Trend Micro IWSS

Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Suite combats internet threats at the entry point, the Internet gateway. This suite provides a comprehensive solution that blocks spyware and malware attacks and prohibits access to known malicious websites. An option to clean infected PCs is also available.
