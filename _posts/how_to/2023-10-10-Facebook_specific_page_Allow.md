# Overview

Facebook, a popular social networking platform, provides users with a multimedia interactive environment. It also offers a variety of applications to enhance user experience. While many organizations aim to restrict Facebook access, there's often a need to permit access to certain specific pages.

SafeSquid SWG Edition empowers both home users and IT managers to grant access to specific company pages on Facebook. With SafeSquid, you can provide:

- Access to a specific company's Facebook page for your social media group
- Partial access for a customer service group
- Read-only access for other groups

Moreover, Facebook access can be time-regulated, allowing relaxed permissions during lunch breaks or after business hours.

## Understand the possibilities

In the provided example, access is granted solely to the SafeSquid page on Facebook. Attempting to access any other pages will result in a block template being displayed. Similarly, you can craft a policy to exclusively allow your company's Facebook page.

# Prerequisites

- HTTPS Inspection must be enabled in SafeSquid. If not, refer to the document - [How to enable HTTPS Inspection](#).

# Access the SafeSquid User Interface
