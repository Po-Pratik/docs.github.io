# Overview

Enforce SafeSearch on Google search results using SafeSquid. With this setup, SafeSearch cannot be disabled, ensuring a safer browsing experience on Google. While SafeSearch isn't foolproof, it helps in blocking explicit content, including pornography, from your Google search results.

# Prerequisites

Enable HTTPS Inspection in SafeSquid. Refer to our guide: [How To Enable HTTPS Inspection](#).

# Access The SafeSquid User Interface

When saving the configuration, you may be prompted to store your settings in the cloud.

    - You wish to use this configuration on other SafeSquid instances.
    - Your entire configuration across all sections is complete and validated.

Otherwise, select "No" and click "Submit".
