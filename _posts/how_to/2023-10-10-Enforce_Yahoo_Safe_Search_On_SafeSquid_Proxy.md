# Overview

Ensure SafeSearch functionality on Yahoo Search results with SafeSquid. By enforcing SafeSearch, users cannot disable it. SafeSearch is essential for filtering explicit content, such as pornography, ensuring a safer browsing experience on Yahoo Search.

# Prerequisites

- SSL Inspection should be activated in SafeSquid. Refer to our guide on [How To Enable HTTPS Inspection](#).

Upon saving the configuration, a prompt may ask if you wish to store your settings in the cloud. 

- Select "Yes" if:
    - You plan to use this configuration on other SafeSquid instances.
    - Your entire configuration across all sections is complete and validated.

Otherwise, select "No" and click on "Submit".
