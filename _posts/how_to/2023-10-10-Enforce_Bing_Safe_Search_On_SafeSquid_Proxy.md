# Overview

Enforce SafeSearch on Bing search results using SafeSquid. With this setup, SafeSearch cannot be disabled, ensuring a safer browsing experience on Bing. While SafeSearch isn't foolproof, it helps in blocking explicit content, including pornography, from your Bing search results.

# Prerequisites

Enable SSL Inspection in SafeSquid. Refer to our guide: [How To Enable HTTPS Inspection](#).

    - Your entire configuration across all sections is complete and validated.

Otherwise, select "No" and click "Submit".
