# Overview

Facebook is a widely used social networking platform that allows users to engage with others in a diverse online environment. Various features, such as applications, enhance user experience. Many organizations see the importance of Facebook for morale, retention, and recruitment, but also want to manage its use.

Instances of cyberbullying, stalking, and negative workplace consequences from posts necessitate a balanced approach. Unrestricted access is not viable for many entities, while a total ban is too strict. Is there a compromise?

With SafeSquid SWG Edition, users and IT managers can activate Facebook's "read-only" mode. This offers a solution where full access is given to marketing teams, partial access for customer service, and read-only access for the rest. Time-based permissions can also be set.

## Facebook Read only mode

Possible features include:
- Restricting "Like", "Comment", and "Share".
- Blocking specific Facebook apps.
- Permitting Facebook login only for selected users or groups.
- Disabling Facebook chat.

# Prerequisites
