# Problem

Bob is encountering issues when configuring policies on SafeSquid SWG and has experienced a crash during this process.

# Benefits

Generating a support tarball can help troubleshoot network-related issues or policy configuration problems. This tarball contains SafeSquid logs, section information, system logs, the `config.xml` file, disk usage data within the `filesystem.txt` file, any `iptables` rules, and network settings in the `network.txt` file.

Additionally, generating a support tarball via the SafeSquid interface allows users to backup their current configuration.

# Prerequisite

- SafeSquid must be installed.
- SafeSquid must be activated.

# Access the SafeSquid User Interface

In future releases, options for mail alerts will be available. This means that when SafeSquid creates a new support tarball following a crash and sends it to SafeSquid servers, users will receive email alerts on their registered email IDs.
