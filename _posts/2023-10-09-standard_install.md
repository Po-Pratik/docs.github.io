> **Note1:** If you are doing standard installation on Physical machine using USB bootable pendrive, after installation has been completed with USB bootable pendive and initial login with administrator (sudo -i), run the following commands:

```shell
grub-install /dev/sda
update-grub
reboot
```
As soon as you remove the USB bootable pendrive, it should display a prompt for login.

> **Note:** The above commands are only required to run if it displays a blank screen after removing the USB bootable pendrive.

## Setting Up Two Network Cards for Static Addressing

First, find the name of the card using the command:

```shell
dmesg | grep -i network
```

You can also search for "eth" instead of "network".

In this case, configure two network cards, `eth0` and `eth1`:

```shell
[ 1.165623] e1000 0000:00:03.0: eth0: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
[ 1.645478] e1000 0000:00:08.0: eth1: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
```

Use the following command to find available network interfaces:

```shell
ifconfig
```

For `eth0`, it's already configured during SafeSquid Appliance Builder(SAB) installation.

To enable `eth1`, edit the network configuration:

```shell
vim /etc/network/interfaces
```

The file content:

```shell
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.223.101
    netmask 255.255.0.0
    network 192.168.0.0
    broadcast 192.168.255.255
    gateway 192.168.1.10

# The secondary network interface
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
    address 10.1.0.101
    netmask 255.255.0.0
    network 10.1.0.0
    broadcast 10.1.255.255
    gateway 10.1.0.100
```

To restart the `eth1` network interface:

```shell
service network-interface restart INTERFACE=eth1 
```
